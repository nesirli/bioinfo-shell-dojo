6| 
7| This repository is organized as follows:
8| 
9| * **Software Carpentry Exercises:** Contains notes, command examples, and reflections from working through sections 1-3 and the lab book of the Software Carpentry "The Unix Shell" lesson.
10| * **Loops in Bash:** Includes a `loops.sh` script (`loops.sh`) demonstrating the use of loops in Bash scripting.
11| * **FASTQ ID Extraction:** Features a one-liner command for listing unique identifiers within FASTQ files.
12| * **Text Processing Mini-Exercise:**
13|     * `show_fastq_ids.sh`: A Bash script designed to extract sequence IDs from a FASTA file.
14| * **Phred Score Utility:**
15|     * `qbase`: A utility script (Python) that calculates the mean Phred score per read in a FASTQ file.

17| ## Getting Started
18| 
19| To explore the contents of this repository, simply navigate through the directories and files. The scripts are intended to be executed in a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL[...]
20| 
21| ### Prerequisites
22| 
23| * **Bash:** For running the shell scripts (`.sh`).
24| * **Python:** Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
25| 
26| ### Usage
27| 
28| 1.  **Software Carpentry Notes:** Review the markdown files containing notes and reflections on the Software Carpentry lessons. Execute the command examples in your own terminal to practice.
29| 2.  **`loops.sh`:** Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal and run:
30|     ```bash
31|     bash loops.sh
32|     ```
33| 3.  **FASTQ ID One-liner:** This is a command to be executed in the terminal. The exact command will depend on the structure of your FASTQ files (e.g., using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `sort-u`).
34| 4.  **`show_fastq_ids.sh`:**
35|     ```bash
36|     bash show_fastq_ids.sh
37|     ```
38|    
39| 5.  **`qbase`:**
40|         python3 qbase.py

42| ## Reflections and Learning
43| 
44| This repository serves as a record of learning and applying fundamental Unix shell commands and scripting techniques relevant to bioinformatics. 
45| 
46| ## Further Exploration
47| 
48| * Revisit the Software Carpentry "The Unix Shell" lesson for a deeper understanding of the concepts covered.
49| * Experiment with modifying the provided scripts and one-liners to handle
50|   different bioinformatics tasks.
51| * Explore other powerful command-line tools commonly used in bioinformatics,
52|   such as `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `head`, `tail`, and more.
53| * Consider learning more advanced Bash scripting for automating complex bioinformatics workflows.
